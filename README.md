### Hey!👋 I'm Ben (he/him) and sometimes I write code.

👨‍💻I love engaging with the tech community, whether it's through OSS, my podcast, or writing posts and articles. In the past I've been fortunate enough to write for Hackaday, The Register, the Stackoverflow Blog, and Devclass.

🌳I also love sustainability and will happily talk about the intersection of climate change and technology for hours.
