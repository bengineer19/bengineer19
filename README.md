### Hello! I'm Ben (he/him) and sometimes I write code.

* 👨‍💻I love engaging with the tech community, whether it's through Open Source, my podcast, or writing posts and articles. In the past I've been fortunate enough to write for Hackaday, The Register, the Stackoverflow Blog, and Devclass.
* 🎷 I play jazz piano and occasionally produce electronic music. I built the site (but not the content) of [vst4free.com](https://vst4free.com/), a repository of free high quality plugins for music producers, with millions of annual users
* 🌳 I'm fascinated by the complexity of sustainability and will happily talk about the intersection of climate change and technology for hours.
